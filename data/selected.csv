Frizzyawkward,"I’m a soon to be veteran looking to get into vet school. I’ll be doing all my prereqs at UTK and hoping for the best when I apply. 
Any tips for getting volunteer hours? I had a bunch in high school about 6 years ago now through my schools veterinary assistance program but I have no contact with anyone that would verify that. Besides maybe the classes on my highschool transcripts I wouldn’t really have “proof”. 
I’ve been active duty these 6 years and I know I’m seriously behind other candidates but don’t want to give up 😭 Any tips in general for a late starter?",Other

ARatNamedClydeBarrow,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I’m losing one of my new grads and I’m super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn’t have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.|I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER. I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients don’t want to listen.|As a VA, this makes me so sad for you.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.|I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER. I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients don’t want to listen.",Vet

You might consider manually setting up your firewall, or migrating to a node on the cloud.

AWS offers a free linux server that you can run the node on, that's what i've been doing so I don't compromise my home network, if you get into that problem with the server just stop the instance and restart to get a brand new IP! Its also easier to configure your firewall there using ufw for example.

PS: Would be great if u/MYST_team took a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/) though, this is a concern for node runners.|Yeah. 

""Verified partner traffic"" is basically sadly corporatish talk to say that they vouche for this traffic, but I anything goes still wrong... are we supposed to entrust the elusive unnamed validity checker entity will come over to the court room and plead for our case?

I wouldn't bet my legal defense on operators of a dVPN network, for the exact same reason I wanted to be part of this network: independence, ownership of ones own data, privacy.

I would choose way over that being able to vouche for my own traffic and have the means to defend myself in case of legal troubles, because, and that's a big one:

\> what's worth a decentralized VPN if node runners would have to rely on a centralized authority to back their legal safety?|Two things:

* That's one person in one country. Just saying ""twas not me, I run node"" without logs in hand is worth nothing to French authorities for example. The ""there was one guy who"" isn't really pertinent.
* Torrenting is kind of the least serious thing you could be concerned about legally. I think I already gave a few examples above that would prompt authorities of anywhere to not give a fuck about your argument of ""twas not me, I run node"" if you don't have means to prove it was someone else's doing.|\> NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed.

Yeah no, I confirm that to be protected, under french law, you have to have the above-mentioned details in your logs, or it's worth nothing as proof, just 'good enough' to assume you MAY be innocent, and it's up to whether or not the judge likes your face and had their coffee in the morning.

&#x200B;

\>The government is pretty strict about these things and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions

Yup, even though they are ""kinda"" slow. Hadopi went through so many changes, and was such a wonky system that even if I 'technically' had a fair amount of reasons to receive notices from them (and did), I never receive 2 in a short enough period that the first was still valid and counting in the X/3 counter.

&#x200B;

\>I also can not assume that the Mysterium whitelisted traffic is benign.

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

Running a D-VPN node, decentralized VPN node, for this exact reason, why should we, and how could we then rely on a 'centralized' committee/deciding entity to validate what is Ok or not to run through our connections, and how could ""validation"" ever **prevent** 'validated parties' to miss-behave, and how said centralized validation body would ever care to or be able to plea for the node runner's innocence against the infractions committed by their validated partners.|Okay, great, multiple people, but still the case of one single country and jurisdiction, and still solely copyright issues.

And yes I know there is whitelisting, which basically excludes non-mysterium approved traffic, which basically excludes private users and randos all together, which basically defeats the reason I'm running a node at all, which is to give wider and less censored internet access to people, individuals, not just entities and organizations.|Same, I think I had around 30 sessions from Benin, and my previous biggest client (\~24h/450GB) was from a Japanese IP.|It seems they like to ping for uptime/latency, or that Netherland has a bigger community of dVPN clients.|for just 2 weeks of running this node, if it keeps going at this rate every week a big client like that, I will fucking offset the powerdraw of my whole rack just with mysterium.|French residential IP, I don't mind answering, I have enough old comments in french speaking of stuff happening in France that I'm already country-doxed.|https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3|THIS, is the reason I run a node.

As nothing but a tinkerer, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) is a post I made a while back when I started running a node, and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/comment/hw2bwil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of the 'extra steps' I took and considered.

I would advocate Mysterium nodes (or any front-facing thing period) to never be ran natively, which I why I went ahead from the start with the ""unsupported"" configuration of running it on a sudoer user in its own dedicated unprivileged LXC container, and doing some fairly extended firewalling from the host (proxmox).

To be honest I would prefer Mysterium nodes to be distributed in this kind of form, as a turnkey LXC package for example. Little overhead, good perfs, and great for isolation/segregation. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i05wele/ | Well, I defo did joined the cause, and discussed both the pros and the cons and some concerns with the community:

I admit I just had not noticed u/peter-sovietsquirrel was part of the team, I was just focused on answering every incoming observation and opinion the best I could.

I understand about your position, sadly I doubt it would suffice in France to be out of troubles.

If it can indeed let the node-runner deny responsibility of the activity he was taken to court for, it could still lead to fines and sanctions as running a somewhat critical service without proper -*and mandatory by law\*\*(see refs)*\- traceability, allowing bad actors to stay out of reach.

In the example in Germany, the guy was contacted by Right holders for copyright issues.

In France, you're directly facing Hadopi (now the [Arcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Authority_for_Audiovisual_and_Digital_Communication)). Their ""notices"" are warnings you can't rebut fully without going to court, and at the third in a given time period, your uplink is shut down and cops knock at your door.

Unless you're running a website with a mail address to be contacted on concerning copyright on the same IP, there is no ""amicable step"" of just talking the Right holders out beforehand.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind though I was **NOT** raising really concerns about relatively mundane stuff like torrenting or using an other country's netflix geo-locked catalogue (even if you can still end up with sanctions like fines);

But **WAY MORE** sensitive crimes, like cyber attacks or 'child media', for which French authorities, like the [ANSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_nationale_de_la_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_des_syst%C3%A8mes_d%27information), would descend hard on you for being the roadblock in their investigation that made the actual criminals unreachable, and possibly charge you same as an accomplice.

&#x200B;

Concerning your no-log policy you want to abide by, **I hear you and won't push it further**, though I see it a bit as a marketing buzz-word in the VPN world which is only a matter of context.

I like transparency and control, hence why I'm much into the vision of web3.0, /hence why I would have wished node runners to have options to define AND transparently disclose their own policies about logging for every dVPN-client to see in their client interface.

All I can do now is hope that you or maybe an other network will consider it and implement it properly.

I'll still be hanging out in the community, and participating by running my node though with very custom filtering rules inside and outside the LXC container to avoid abuse.

**I take the pledge** to not stir up the topic of logging outside of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/) as to not disturb the community by starting useless debates, though I would be happy to discuss it again if the question is raised officially one day.

(as such, I also added an edit to the thread.)

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

And yes I know there is whitelisting, which basically excludes non-mysterium approved traffic, which basically excludes private users and randos all together, which basically defeats the reason I'm running a node at all, which is to give wider and less censored internet access to people, individuals, not just entities and organizations. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxx2htr/ | Well, Chromebook means most likely you're still running ChromeOS... aka Gentoo Linux... which isn't really like 'standard' debian based linux for example.

Running a native node to which randos will connect to isn't really the best thing either if anything goes wrong.

I would say, for sake of simplicity, your best shot would be to first run an unprivileged LXC container, and install a small debian based image in it, make sure it can connect to the internet, AND gets its own IP on the local network (for sake of easy port-forwarding).

It would let you have a proper install that doesn't affect your host's configuration, and that you have absolute control over if needed.

Then follow the standard Linux CLI install.

When it comes to resources, my own full OS LXC container on proxmox, with the node running, and while the session is active, doesn't use more than 2.5gigs of storage space, and half of its assigned 128mb of ram. A bit storage heavy, but overall light to run.

If you wanna add a layer of security, possibly go into IPtables on your chromeOS/gentoo host and isolate it from the IPrange of your network, minus node's webui (port 4449), and minus gateway communications, but still blocking sensitive stuff like the gateway's webui and ports like 22/445/512.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Important note: If you already have a node running, having a second node on the same IP doesn't make any positive change, might even penalize you. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxjjgmg/ | Thought little more tip:

You should give 3gigs of storage space total to the LXC container.

Using a lean debian 11 image, the node install script would fail with a 2gig virtual drive, because while unpacking you go over that amount.

&#x200B;

If you encounter issues, or want more details about how I went about with my setup, you can find a long read about it on a previous post of mine where I encountered some miss-configurations during installation (and some weird behavior that really wasn't how things should go), how I did some firewall configuration ect [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/), or see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/comment/hw8j91c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when with someone I went about firewall configuration for a docker install (which I haven't done myself, but wanted to know how I would go about doing it).

Their actually-intended default configuration looks to be fine. Not the best, but clearly mindful.

I would guess what caused this behavior on my setup is somehow wireguard or myst didn't configured itself properly, or had issues interacting, fluke knows why, in my LXC container, even though the only modifications done to have the mysterium install script work was to spoof it to generic linux headers, fill in missing packets and add some gpg repo keys manually.

Something, between this or a quirk in the default debian11--container-image provided by proxmox might have borked something.

I solved the issue on my end, but I'll keep the firewall good-behavior cage around the container just for peace of mind and added layer of security.

So it might be specific to this kind of installation, but **if it can bork like** ***that*** **and this easily**, adding a way to review and modify the wireguard and firewall config (what parameters are to be applied to ephemeral wireguard interfaces) directly from the webui would allow plug&play-expecting beginners/neophytes to be warned about, troubleshoot and fix such issues, especially since not everyone would go from a clean install or strictly supported and tested distro/config.

Maybe a mindful feature to implement in the near future?

I expressly follow the native linux install guide, aka the **fucking manual**. I haven't touched how Mysterium configures wireguard by default.

Had to just tweak the linux headers install process and patch in the missing packets (using snapshots to launch the install, get errored out, snapshot rollback, pre-install packets, not get errored out at the same step, rinse and repeat)

I'm just here venting the fact that the default install (aka, by the book) looks to have a concerning oversight in its configuration. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveo6p9/ | *\[ -using docker can let someone achieve even host isolation \]*

Such as LXC unpriviledged container too in my case. I commend mysterium's guide to at least advise beginners to create a sudoer user instead of running the node as root, but I was more worried about beginners/neophytes who would run their node bare-metal, like on a raspPi, or on an old spare laptop/computer... possibly with a slew of vulnerabilities, or worse even, with other services running on that same box that could badly interact and/or be exploited, **plus** the fact that in this case you can't firewall it *from outside* like a container without a proper firewall box plugged to it, where user-friendly market end users are more-often-than-not using their ISP's holly router as sole 'smart' network equipment. 

*\[Also, I think that better work to prevent bad traffic FROM the node can be taken.\]*

Yes indeed, for the proxmox firewall-ing of the container, I denied it all interaction (egress and ingress) with the full IP range used by hosts on the network(minus gateway), along with sensitive gateway ports like its webui for example, or ports that would allow to gather information on the maker/software of the gateway.

Exception made of needed things such as the node's webui, still reachable by a few select hosts.

Technically, the node's container could even be rooted that who ever is in it still couldn't touch the Lan.

Imo, and that's a very personal view on it, given **the stakes of running a wide open vpn node to a residential network**, Mysterium nodes should be advised to be used **only** in containerized form (docker/lxc/lxd) since they're aiming at and talking to a mainly beginner audience.  
\+ Docker or LXD(using snap) should let it run just fine on a raspPi, and without some of the risks.  
Distributing it as a ready-to-run container would also avoid any chance of fluke-miss-configuration upon installation.

Concerning your contribution plans, DNS filtering yes yes, would be very welcomed, and god yes monitoring. Saw in the issue thread you were thinking of graphana integration as a possibility, that would be great!

Whenever you create your repo and push something you consider satisfactory or need people to beta-test, don't hesitate to ping me if you want me to add it to an edit at the top of the post for everyone to benefit from it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvoyhzr/ | As you say, I know you're supposed to, at least for peace of mind.

But instead of just brut-blocking shit like a creature of habit keyboard facepalmer, I wanted to know what Mysterium's out-of-the-box experience was, and its behavior on an *almost typical residential network*. Observe the enemy.

Since this Dapp advertises itself as an user-friendly/**beginner-friendly** secure VPN, I took on myself to actually test its claims by following the install guide and **not** doing any extra *smart stuff* about it (aside from Proxmox-LXC image specific patching ups)

I allowed myself to see how Mysterium behaves out of the box in a controlled environment with solely already fairly hardened hosts on the network, all the hosts on that network have restrictive firewalls, SSL certificates with my own local CA, SSH keys, ect, and critical shit like IPMI interfaces or proxmox's datacenter access is segregated to an other network all together.

But the network I tested this on is managed by a residential off-the-shelf-from-my-ISP router with fairly standard config and features to the average consumer's.

And I came back to report on what I saw? To give a heads up to 'neophyte/beginner' node runners who may just have followed a tutorial to install it on a spare laptop or RaspPI they had lying around?

That maaaay be why my post is flaired as an alert, not a question. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveszrn/ | Mhm.

Basically if it was something that you know you have to do SOME config to selfhost, like a nginx+certbot reverseproxy&certification setup, it's assumed that you're gonna have to trust in the tutorial of whoever blogposter or content creator you learn from, and you know from the start that it will be a little journey and have to have security in mind.

But Mysterium presents itself as a set&forget for both node and client, and competing in the same space as centralized VPNs... not exactly the same ""targets"" obviously, the more curious-tinkerer ones, but ultimately its communication is leveled to speak to end users.

And I mean 'end-users', little to no skill/knowledge requirement announced.

And thus, the Node runner guide is roughly the same length as the DVPN user guide, in appearance thus ""as simple and straightforward"".

That's how it's 'marketed', by the Mysterium team as well as every content creator I saw talking about it.

Encouraging whoever will give them an ear to set up a node on a raspberrypi by just flashing and heading straight to the webui, no further configuration, or else to do it on a spare computer, spin up a fresh install of ubuntu or debian, install myst, jump to webui, no further configuration.

The section in which the guide actually talks about firewall and NAT is solely about troubleshooting an offline node... aka, tell you to punch holes, but not really anything about plugging up holes.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say ""Mysterium bad"", because it's indeed the node runner's responsibility to secure their network, and to not install shit on it they can't control.

But share fault, because you wouldn't advertise a sport car as a ""beginner friendly"" car to a new driver on probation license, and *omit* to tell them it's delivered with ABS toggled off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvh8m4r/ | *\[How did you block the webui? A rule using the container ip/subnet itself? What about the container localhost?\]*  
*\[Wich rules did you use? You have some suggestions?\]*  


Concerning the webui specifically, I actually limited from the outside-container firewall's ingress to the 4449 container port with as sources specific network IPs, dropping every other source.  
I will admit I took no action to protect the node's webui from dVPNclients connecting to the node (which shouldn't be needed if the node's config is applied properly), but I'm not too worried about it:

* webui's password is 50+ characters long, and not reused anywhere else, as well is the root password of the unpriviledged LXC container, and as well is the sudoer user password.
* I'm not running a decentralized VPN node for profit, but by conviction. Nothing they could do in the webui could damage my network, worse case scenario they steal my MYSTT, which I don't care about.

&#x200B;

When it comes to the other firewall's rules, I did my firewalling specific to my setup, and I re-iterate, I'm not a security expert or an expert anything, my *suggestions* I would be more curious to see how much you'll roast my firewalling more than anything!

Second, keep in mind I did all that as a container's firewall, configured from the host, which is applied to the virtual NIC from the host perspective.  
Leaving the source IP blank on firewall egress on that NIC means it catches all potential IPs the node may use.

\-**Egress** \- default Output policy : **Accept**.

Let's start: first a few destination ports this node should never have to contact, who ever is using that through a VPN is clearly trying to poke around, **Reject** on all:

* 514 in udp (remote syslog)
* 445 in tcp (active directory and samba shares, previously also netbios on old windows versions)
* 135 tcp&udp (MS RPC)
* 137-139 tcp&udp (Netbios IP legacy)
* 161-162 udp (SNMP)
* I technically should (you should) block IRC ports (6660-6669 tcp) because a lot of botnet use them, but since I run my node per conviction of help to stop speech/info censorship, I want IRC chats to be reachable through it.

Then **Reject** egress by macro HTTPS and HTTP destined to the precise IPs (CIDR32) of all my subnet's gateways, to protect their web interfaces.

Then **Reject** all egress to an IPset that represents all the static IPs of all server hosts on the on all the subnets (by CIDR32)(multiple proxmox nodes, an unraid NAS) (redundant with the rule bellow, but eh, peace of mind for a moron)

Then an IPset that take each of my subnets IP ranges (CIDR24), minus the ones of the gateways (CIDR24), and **Reject** all egress to them.

\----------------  
Then we need to talk a bit of why my network is structured like shit:  
I'm on fiber (2Gbps down, 600mbps up)  
My ISP (which is the most stable in my location, hence why I'm with them) doesn't deliver a modem and a router. The router has an onboard integrated modem.  
Not an SFP+ slot, not a coax, not anything, I legit have single mode fiber cable between a wallplate and my internet box.  
If I wanted to use my own equipment, I would be a proprietary firmware ONT SFP+ hacking journey that, even successful, could fail any day without notice whenever my ISP change something on their side.  
Also, that shitty box doesn't support ANYTHING. No link aggregation/DACP/trunk, not multiple subnets, not ip ranges superior to /24, not VLANs, and ONLY has 4 1gbps ports.  
So I just threw together a small OPNsense box that manages 4 subnets (including the IPMI management one and the one dedicated to hosts administration like the ssh and webuis of proxmox and unraid), but the 'main' subnet is directly onto the ISP router... because my OPNsense box is a very low power salvage, and would struggle too much with the kind of throughput I have.

Hence why the last egress rules are very specific to my setup and dedicated to ""patch"" issues with that shitty router/gateway I'm stuck with, and not really relevant to list here, but if you're curious, here's a nice [example](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-20377/) from one of the previous models from my ISP, hence my lack of trust.  
By default you can think about putting a **Reject** on all egress that would have gateways as destination on ports like 21 22 and 23 for example.  
Still, it's 'setup specific'! (I don't feel comfy sharing these to be honest, to not expose if I overlooked something important that could then be exploited!)  
\-------------

If I didn't had a brain-derp, it should allow the node wide access to the world wide web on most ports, minus ones that are in the non-sense category, while excluding all my subnets' hosts from being reachable, still worse case scenario allows to 'sense' my gateways but not know what maker/type they are.

&#x200B;

**Ingress** \- default Input policy: **Drop**

Then using an Alias that represent the ONLY allowed IP of the node on my network (thus excluding potential 'spawns' which would then default to drop all ingress), I defined these rules to that Alias:

**Accept** ingress on 4449 (webui) and 22 (SSH) from an IPset of specific (CIDR32) local ips

**Drop** a little list of outright all sources ingress, for peace of mind: 20,21,22,23,67,68,69,79,98,110,111,113,119, all sources. I'm almost sure I did a mistake in there, but so far people connecting to the node don't seem to have been to distraught about it, since I had clients with hour long sessions.

**Reject** on all port the IPset of all my subnets' on /24CIDRs minus the gateways (cleaner than drop for local network, that same rule is the default on all my hosts and their containers/VM, to reduce propagation risks from a compromised host to an other)

**Reject** a macro HTTPS/HTTP/LDAP ingress, because I don't want people to use it as a webhost (I'm selfhosting some stuff myself, that doesn't seem to be a good idea), denying LDAP is to avoid being used as a proxy for log4j exploits that use LDAP, but there is probably a lot more I could/should block

**Accept** on the ranges 10000:25560,25570:60000, to let clients connect to the node through the widest range of ports it uses and listens to.   
Only left a little space in the middle because I have friend's MC servers running.

That's about it, minus a few rules to no-log some stuff like the ISP router doing some multicast to 224.0.0.0/24,its-subnet/24, and pinging the shit out of everything.

To anyone reading, it's not advice, and I probably made a terrible mistake somewhere, don't copy, ask for an actual security expert, which I'm not.

&#x200B;

*\[In my case, I'm not going to run nodes in a home network/home lab environment, I'm not comfortable with that.\]*

Understandable!

*\[I'm running them hosting/vps etc.\]*

I considered it. Though often hosting/vps IPs are blocked by a lot of services (including streaming plateforms), but also are very susceptible to being blocked and/or monitored by countries/organizations which intend to censor and do speech/opposition repression, which kinda would defeat the point of why I run a node!

*\[I'm planning to use SWAG\]*

I already use SWAG to frontface some stuff to a cloudflare proxy, but I plan on switching to traefik for that too, which I already use internally for SSL for stuff that isn't publicly 'presented'.  
You could add a layer of auth (+ with 2fauth on top) using Authelia eventually.


[1/2] ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bwil/ | [2/2]

*\[For this in planning to: \[...\]\]*

That's indeed a whole stack! What could be a solution would be to produce a shell script that, in a standard LXC (or even baremetal) bog standard debian, would pull all the mysterium pihole suricata etc needed sources and automatize most of the config, only asking to input the parameters needed (like the static IP, subnetIPrange/CIDR, and gateway(s) to use for the stack on the actual local network) in order to make it as secure as it should be and as beginner friendly as it advertises itself to be.

As you saw, my setup is waaaaaay simpler than that, probably also way less informed, but in a situation were I don't care about the node's 'internal' security that much, more about it not touching anything in my turf and not being used 'too' maliciously.

&#x200B;

*\[In any case I thank you for the insights, the suggestions you're giving and for volunteering to help with the repo.\]*

My *'insights'* are more just remarks/conceptions of someone who has widespread but sparse understanding/knowledge, with a lot of holes.  
I saw stuff that seemed (almost instinctively) problematic, and while I can conceptualize solutions, building a whole stack (let alone automating it) that would both be completely securely tight AND plug&play is kinda beyond my skills.   
I see myself further in the category of code tinkerer than actual coder, more a security enthusiast and not at all an expert.

I will indeed check out the repo, probably try it myself, report on it, eventually point out issues if I see some, but I probably won't have a complete solution to anything!

Though as I said, as soon as you're comfortable enough with your repo, I'll link it at the top of the post in an edit, so more eyes are on it, and probably some from people who are more knowledgeable and crafty than myself!  


  
*\[Looking forward to read your opinions.\]*

Yup, well, indeed it was more opinions than solutions or even insights from my part.

Looking forward to see you roast my firewall rules ;) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bzaz/ | *\[To be honest you did a great job, I'd just add blocking of malformed IP packets and rate limits for SYN and ICMP packets.\]*

Showing how much I'm not an expert, I actually never tried to do that with Proxmox's firewall, I'll have to try that!

*\[Regarding traefik, I think it is way better to stand with nginx, and especially swag that has fail2ban integrated.\]*

Fair! I just found traefik a bit easier to play with, but that's entierely personal. It's more flexible when it comes to adding removing services on the fly, doesn't need reloads or rebuilds. Hence my choice for internal SSL!

I think it's just that failtoban looses a bit of its importance when I'm hiding with cloudflare's proxy, caching and filtering.  


*\[On the VPS vs ISP: I honestly think that they are still monitored in any case.\]*

Yeah ISPs are monitored like VPS are, but residential addresses are not as blocked as datacenter IPs from a country to an other, or by platforms that geoblock.

My node is thus still available to a wider audience, with access to a wider array of services than if it was running on a VPS I think.

Also I'm kinda serving my own ends by running a node, because my internet usage from my ISP's point of view becomes an indecipherable mess of a wide array of profiles and languages mixed together, basically stopping them from building a profile.

In that way, 'being a VPN' can protect your identity almost as much as using one.

&#x200B;

*\[wich DNS will be used by the VPN client\]*

I'm puzzled about it too.

But I would assume they are using the DNS they are configured with on their machine, since I haven't seen (or else missed it) custom DNS options in the VPN's code ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwehrap/ | 1. no. I'm running mine in an LXC debian container with as available resources 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor, and 128mb of ram. A session just finished at this moment after 23h58 with \~445GB transfered, and the node didn't even touched half its resources. It's not resource intensive at all.
2. yes. you will be better placed to have clients who will send/receive lots of data. 1GB earns you almost as much as 200hours of session. Ping can also matter to some clients.
3. Not on the same IP, I doubt it.
4. Yes. But better use IPs from different regions of the world than your neighbor's or grandma's, who ultimately have ""the same internet"" as you, same geo-locks/laws/censorships. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sojaqr/best_way_to_maximise_network_node_earnings/hw9hjua/ | Not. They are most likely either watching ultra HD, or torrenting.

We passed the 100GB bar at the moment. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw5jr93/ | **After** this amount of traffic? Well, the session is still going. 16th hour.

The node is indeed residential, but in a virtualized environment, with a firewall applying to it from outside its container.  
If you're curious about security, I had a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) where I had a configuration issue outside the box and quite a bit of discussion in the comments.

And since I'm not on whitelist, be conscious I may be taking a bit of a risk.

&#x200B;

Other than that, we are at 275GB on this session at the moment I'm writing, the container still doesn't use more resources, still at 62MiB of used memory. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw7pqfi/ | I can't give you a straight answer, the previous ""long session"" I had was a 19hours long from Japan who transferred \~750mB, and I had a dozen of ""short sessions"" who did about 100 to 500mB.  
Key points:

\- I'm on a 2Gbps down 600mbps up connection

\- I have low ping

\- My node's self-test indicates it is 'Full cone', so I am as reachable as possible (while with docker container I could only achieve Symmetric Nat restricted cone, surely due to how my network and hosts are structured)

\- Clearly allocated resources don't matter. Allocated 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor and 128mb of ram of RAM to the debian LXC container, the average use of these both was under half the total allocation for the whole 23h58 session, and the few CPU spikes weren't above 80-90%... so 8-9% of a 9th 35WTDP cpu.

&#x200B;

So I don't know how I attracted them, but I guess what made them stay was stability, throughput and ping? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hweiqdt/ | Well, running myst bare metal is indeed more risky than running it in a container if anything goes wrong or miss-configured.

I will give you under what 'advices' I can, keep in mind I'm not a security expert, just a tinkerer, and I'm not above making mistakes when giving advices either, it's to give you a 'guideline' idea!

Taking a raspberry Pi as an example, given how little resources the node uses, it's a bit of a waste of a Pi to just run the node on it.

So the idea would be to have the Mysterium node running in docker and segregated from your other docker containers that you then could run on your PI, and also segregated from your network.

* Without going too deep into it, here's what my recommendations would be for a rasp-pi node:
* install bog-standard raspbian
* install docker
* go for a docker container installation of myst instead of bare metal.

It being in docker means you can also more easily set up firewall rules for the container outside of the container, which means that if anything goes wrong **within** the Mysterium container, in all logic it shouldn't be able to bypass your firewall rules or touch your host so long it's an unprivileged container.

The bare minimum rules to protect your network would be the following, assuming your IP range is 192.168.0.0/24 (aka 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255, and your gateway(router) is 192.168.0.1):

Create a network bridge in docker that will let the container have its own IP:

    $docker network create -d macvlan --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range 192.168.0.128/31 --gateway 192.168.0.1 -o parent=eth0 br0docker

(I leave it the possibility to take ip 192.168.0.128 or 192.168.0.129 to avoid possible conflicts, but you can reduce it to one with /32, or expend the range)

&#x200B;

Create an IPset that represents your local network, minus your gateway:

    $ipset create lan-gw hash:net comment
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.0/24 comment ""lan IP range""
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.1/32 nomatch comment ""gateway""

And one that represent the IPs your node may have:

    $ipset create mystip hash:net comment
    $ipset add mystip 192.168.0.128/31 comment ""mystip""

And one of the IPs on your lan that you want to allow accessing the node's webui:

    $ipset create mystwebui hash:net
    $ipset add mystwebui 192.168.0.24/32

In the example above, only the computer on your lan using the  192.168.1.24 will be able to reach the node's webui. You can add more if needed.

The following firewall rules would be a ""minimal"" security setup imo, to protect your other devices on the network and your router from the node, while still allowing it full connectivity over the dVPN ports, and a select webui access from your chosen device:

    $iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -p tcp --dport 4449 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -j REJECT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -p udp --match multiport --dports 10000:25560,25570:60000 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -m set --match-set lan-gw dst -j DROP
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -d 192.168.0.1 -p tcp --match multiport --dports 22,80,443 -j DROP 
    $iptables --policy INPUT DROP
    $/sbin/iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

(I know -i ethX and other stuff could be used, but just trying to keep it setup-agnostic and simple, all setup change modifications would only require changes in IPset)

I advise you to read a bit about iptables and how docker can modify them, it's a headache but a necessary one.

Make sure your node always starts in docker with the following extra parameter so it gets its own IP, seperate from your Pi host, on your network for ease of portforwarding:

    $docker run --network br0docker .....

As for CLI into the container, use the docker CLI for that from your raspberryPI.

&#x200B;

I haven't done it myself so I can't tell you it's all good to go, but that would be my take on it in my head if I went to do it, if it can be of any help as a starting point.

(I run an LXC container on Proxmox instead, and even then my setup isn't perfect I'm sure). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8j91c/ | I repeat: I'm not a security expert nor anything, just a tinkerer. I might be wrong about some stuff, I may have made mistakes I'm not seeing.

Really the reason I made this answer it's less about giving you instructions to follow, more like giving you the idea/understanding of what we're trying to achieve to secure it, and the steps I imagine I would have to take to make it happen, using only tools that are well documented and recognized.

Again, I don't have a RaspPi atm, I haven't tried it on docker either.

I went for an LXC container so I could test the bare-metal native install in a containerized environment to have more control over it, reduce risks and monitor it, which achieves in essence the same concept of container+outer firewall.

Really the better advice if any that I can give you is to look and ask around, either here or on linux dedicated reddits about IPtables/IPset and Docker, and be curious to dive in documentation/tutorials made by people more knowledgeable and skilled than I am! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8xmrz/ | Well, two things:

I've had clients who went on their own and said they were transferred. Or clients who have called with something that is obviously an emergency on a Friday 10 minutes before close, and we send them elsewhere directly so they say they were transferred when we haven't physically seen the pet in 2 years. I've had clients who I know were given a ballpark estimate and go anyway only to decline everything due to cost because maybe they mulled it over on the car ride over. I recently sent a client to Hospital Y because Hospital X said they weren't taking transfers, and she showed up at Hospital X anyway, so Hospital X got mad at us. 

The closest ER/specialty hospital to us will only book appointments for clients if we call in a referral first, and they also strongly encourage us to call for ER as well. So we do. We like them and want to have good working relationships.

But they only want doctors calling, not techs, even though most of these calls could easily be handled by techs. I don't know how many times I've sat on hold waiting and how many times I've had to call repeatedly because the specialty scheduling person wasn't available. For emergencies, I also don't expect ER docs to be ready and available to talk on the phone immediately because they have a million more important things to do than talk on the phone. And when we have issues getting through, clients get upset and sometimes decide to just go.

As for cost, there are 4-5 referral options near me, and I can't memorize prices for everything for everyone. Inflation hasn't done us any favors, with how many times prices have changed. When I get that info during a call, I pass it along to the client. Whether they actually listen is out of my control.

It's hard on both ends of the relationship. Cut us all some slack and show a little grace for your colleagues who are trying their best.|rDVM here.

Rural areas lack services because working there is not desirable and sometimes not even profitable or sustainable. The work is physically demanding. On call and after hours work are required because if you're literally the only shop in town, you're responsible for providing 24/7/365 care to your patients. Anecdotally, the only people who work in rural practices and stay there long term are people who grew up there and have other ties and other reasons to be there.

What I mean by the retention problem is that many full timers end up leaving the field or dropping down to part time hours. It happens for a lot of different reasons, some related to the field and some related to wider phenomena.

None of these things - literally zero of them - can be fixed by simply opening new schools. Mark Cushing is a vulture, and everyone else is either fooling themselves or taking the opportunity to cash in, taking advantage of people who want to become vets and who will pay $55k+ per year in tuition to some slapdash rickety-ass school to get there. It's gross and a disgrace to the profession.|Looking at the newer schools, Lincoln Memorial University is $52k per year in tuition alone. University of Arizona is $47k. Texas Tech is ""cheap"" at $33k for out of state and $22k for in state. It's the only one I can think of that has state support.

So say you're a bright eyed, bushy tailed student, and you get into one of these new schools. Let's pretend you're lucky and have family pay all of your living expenses and everything other than tuition. Or maybe you had savings to cover that. You graduate with $200k minimum in student loan debt, ignoring the interest that accumulates while you're in school.

Rural jobs are long hours, weekends, holidays, and pay is lower. How are you going to manage your massive debt load from your expensive school by providing services in an area where you make way less money for working way more hours? 

A lot of people start off in this career intending to do large animal, equine, or mixed practice, but the financial realities drive a significant number of those vets into small animal practice in suburban and urban environments. Adding more schools doesn't change that at all.|I think we're more likely to ignore studies that go against our personal experiences, and with metronidazole, it's such a commonly used medication that we all have a lot of experience with it. And we all seem to think it really works. As a GP, I've only seen a handful of blocked cats over 3 years, so I don't have any strong feelings or preferences with prazosin or any other aspects of management. So it's easy to change what I do based on new studies. But I see multiple cases of diarrhea just about every week of the year, so it's really easy to build up anecdata and blind spots.

I try to avoid metro for the most part. I've had good results with fiber supplementation and have gone that route with my own dogs with success. There are some cases where I reach for metro or tylosin if bland diet + fiber + probiotics fails. I also have a handful of clients who are used to getting it every time, so I cave in. And I have one worked up through internal med who is on it chronically. But overall, the evidence for antibiotics causing dysbiosis and predisposing to long term problems is very compelling, and it's all over the human lit as well. So I'm convinced overall.

I'm also wondering about all of these various doodle breeds who seem predisposed to chronic enteropathy. I've had a few who got metro as puppies and have had non-stop issues since. Of course it's impossible to tell if their issues were exacerbated by metro or if they were already going to have exactly the same problems and that's *why* they got metro so early in life in the first place. Still, I really, really try to avoid metro and tylosin in dogs who haven't reached full maturity.|At my current job, prescriptions and refills are a slightly lower %, and heartworm/flea tick is 11%.

I think the biggest sticking point would be that other associates would be giving up these surgery cases to the surgery doctor. You can't get a pet to surgery if you don't have them in for an appointment first, so as someone who likes surgery and likes appointments, I'd be very irritated if I ""lost"" a lot of my cases to someone who didn't want to put the work in to develop the surgical caseload themselves.

Rural areas lack services because working there is not desirable and sometimes not even profitable or sustainable. The work is physically demanding. On call and after hours work are required because if you're literally the only shop in town, you're responsible for providing 24/7/365 care to your patients. Anecdotally, the only people who work in rural practices and stay there long term are people who grew up there and have other ties and other reasons to be there.

What I mean by the retention problem is that many full timers end up leaving the field or dropping down to part time hours. It happens for a lot of different reasons, some related to the field and some related to wider phenomena.

None of these things - literally zero of them - can be fixed by simply opening new schools. Mark Cushing is a vulture, and everyone else is either fooling themselves or taking the opportunity to cash in, taking advantage of people who want to become vets and who will pay $55k+ per year in tuition to some slapdash rickety-ass school to get there. It's gross and a disgrace to the profession.|Looking at the newer schools, Lincoln Memorial University is $52k per year in tuition alone. University of Arizona is $47k. Texas Tech is ""cheap"" at $33k for out of state and $22k for in state. It's the only one I can think of that has state support.

So say you're a bright eyed, bushy tailed student, and you get into one of these new schools. Let's pretend you're lucky and have family pay all of your living expenses and everything other than tuition. Or maybe you had savings to cover that. You graduate with $200k minimum in student loan debt, ignoring the interest that accumulates while you're in school.

I think the biggest sticking point would be that other associates would be giving up these surgery cases to the surgery doctor. You can't get a pet to surgery if you don't have them in for an appointment first, so as someone who likes surgery and likes appointments, I'd be very irritated if I ""lost"" a lot of my cases to someone who didn't want to put the work in to develop the surgical caseload themselves.

And I don't like that I can't check just ALT or any of the individual slides. 

Our practice owner hated Idexx customer service and is very loyal to Antech and Zoetis, but I miss my Idexx machines.

As for general send out lab stuff, I don't have any complaints with Antech vs Idexx, though I rarely miss having quantitative proBNP.|I personally have never seen it, but I don't see why it couldn't happen. I think the biggest sticking point would be that other associates would be giving up these surgery cases to the surgery doctor. You can't get a pet to surgery if you don't have them in for an appointment first, so as someone who likes surgery and likes appointments, I'd be very irritated if I ""lost"" a lot of my cases to someone who didn't want to put the work in to develop the surgical caseload themselves. But I've worked with a bunch of vets who don't do much surgery or any at all, and they were happy to pass on those cases to someone else, so if you have the right mix of people, there's no reason why it can't work.|rDVM here.

I've had clients who went on their own and said they were transferred. Or clients who have called with something that is obviously an emergency on a Friday 10 minutes before close, and we send them elsewhere directly so they say they were transferred when we haven't physically seen the pet in 2 years. I've had clients who I know were given a ballpark estimate and go anyway only to decline everything due to cost because maybe they mulled it over on the car ride over. I recently sent a client to Hospital Y because Hospital X said they weren't taking transfers, and she showed up at Hospital X anyway, so Hospital X got mad at us. 

The closest ER/specialty hospital to us will only book appointments for clients if we call in a referral first, and they also strongly encourage us to call for ER as well. So we do. We like them and want to have good working relationships.

But they only want doctors calling, not techs, even though most of these calls could easily be handled by techs. I don't know how many times I've sat on hold waiting and how many times I've had to call repeatedly because the specialty scheduling person wasn't available. For emergencies, I also don't expect ER docs to be ready and available to talk on the phone immediately because they have a million more important things to do than talk on the phone. And when we have issues getting through, clients get upset and sometimes decide to just go.

As for cost, there are 4-5 referral options near me, and I can't memorize prices for everything for everyone. Inflation hasn't done us any favors, with how many times prices have changed. When I get that info during a call, I pass it along to the client. Whether they actually listen is out of my control.

It's hard on both ends of the relationship. Cut us all some slack and show a little grace for your colleagues who are trying their best.|rDVM here.

Rural areas lack services because working there is not desirable and sometimes not even profitable or sustainable. The work is physically demanding. On call and after hours work are required because if you're literally the only shop in town, you're responsible for providing 24/7/365 care to your patients. Anecdotally, the only people who work in rural practices and stay there long term are people who grew up there and have other ties and other reasons to be there.

What I mean by the retention problem is that many full timers end up leaving the field or dropping down to part time hours. It happens for a lot of different reasons, some related to the field and some related to wider phenomena.

None of these things - literally zero of them - can be fixed by simply opening new schools. Mark Cushing is a vulture, and everyone else is either fooling themselves or taking the opportunity to cash in, taking advantage of people who want to become vets and who will pay $55k+ per year in tuition to some slapdash rickety-ass school to get there. It's gross and a disgrace to the profession.|Looking at the newer schools, Lincoln Memorial University is $52k per year in tuition alone. University of Arizona is $47k. Texas Tech is ""cheap"" at $33k for out of state and $22k for in state. It's the only one I can think of that has state support.

So say you're a bright eyed, bushy tailed student, and you get into one of these new schools. Let's pretend you're lucky and have family pay all of your living expenses and everything other than tuition. Or maybe you had savings to cover that. You graduate with $200k minimum in student loan debt, ignoring the interest that accumulates while you're in school.

Rural jobs are long hours, weekends, holidays, and pay is lower. How are you going to manage your massive debt load from your expensive school by providing services in an area where you make way less money for working way more hours? 

A lot of people start off in this career intending to do large animal, equine, or mixed practice, but the financial realities drive a significant number of those vets into small animal practice in suburban and urban environments. Adding more schools doesn't change that at all.|I think we're more likely to ignore studies that go against our personal experiences, and with metronidazole, it's such a commonly used medication that we all have a lot of experience with it. And we all seem to think it really works. As a GP, I've only seen a handful of blocked cats over 3 years, so I don't have any strong feelings or preferences with prazosin or any other aspects of management. So it's easy to change what I do based on new studies. But I see multiple cases of diarrhea just about every week of the year, so it's really easy to build up anecdata and blind spots.

I try to avoid metro for the most part. I've had good results with fiber supplementation and have gone that route with my own dogs with success. There are some cases where I reach for metro or tylosin if bland diet + fiber + probiotics fails. I also have a handful of clients who are used to getting it every time, so I cave in. And I have one worked up through internal med who is on it chronically. But overall, the evidence for antibiotics causing dysbiosis and predisposing to long term problems is very compelling, and it's all over the human lit as well. So I'm convinced overall.

I'm also wondering about all of these various doodle breeds who seem predisposed to chronic enteropathy. I've had a few who got metro as puppies and have had non-stop issues since. Of course it's impossible to tell if their issues were exacerbated by metro or if they were already going to have exactly the same problems and that's *why* they got metro so early in life in the first place. Still, I really, really try to avoid metro and tylosin in dogs who haven't reached full maturity.|At my current job, prescriptions and refills are a slightly lower %, and heartworm/flea tick is 11%. Any diets (we only carry 2) and OTC products like medicated shampoos, wipes, probiotics are not included. Each hospital is different.|I've worked mostly with Idexx machines, but my new place has Abaxis. I'm not impressed. The image quality and resolution for the urinalysis machine is terrible compared to the Idexx Sedivue.

Varishta,"I would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic. You may fall in love and discover your passion, or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job. Working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect, so I would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place. Loving cats is a great start, but that alone isn’t a good reason to work for a vet. Make sure you’re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are. 

If you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it, there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. They are similar but different positions, especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed. Vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more, but also means more schooling and more responsibility/stress. There are legitimate, respected vet tech schools online, but you’ll still need to find a physical clinic to work with and let you learn the physical skills involved in order to complete the program. In general, vet med is a heavily education and science based field, so more education is generally looked upon favorably, so long as it is from reputable sources.

Vet assistant doesn’t require any courses, though online courses exist and may or may not give you a boost at getting a job as an assistant. Many of them are on the job trained, but that’s easier to do if they at least have some background in working with animals. Kennel assistant is similar and also typically on the job trained, however the pay for both of these positions is usually quite low. I would check job listings in your area to see if it’s even financially feasible for you. 

The last bit of advice I have is to also consider finding a non-animal job with a better work-life balance and make volunteering with cats at the humane society or a rescue more of a hobby. Some people make a career out of something they love, and find that it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it versus when it was a hobby or something they did in their free time. Veterinary professionals have a significantly higher rate of suicide than the general public, one of the highest suicide rates of any profession, because we are all very passionate about animals, but the nature of the job is very physically and emotionally draining. Consider if your mental and emotional health can cope with clients screaming at you and accusing you of personally murdering their dog because they didn’t bring it in soon enough or because the client can’t pay for care, cope with neglectful owners, cope with euthanizing animals that could otherwise be saved, cope with making a mistake that may cost an animal their life, and overall cope with seeing animals suffer on a daily basis. It can be a very rewarding job, but there are days where it will absolutely beat you to the ground and keep kicking while you’re there. This is why I would strongly advise shadowing before deciding if it’s for you or not. There’s nothing wrong with taking a non-animal job and making animals how you decompress in your free time instead.|I wouldn’t get as hung up on taking notes about what you learn. It will likely be pretty overwhelming in the beginning, and as others have said, you’ll have years to learn that stuff in depth. Simple repeated exposure to terminology and concepts will help them stick better down the road. Have a notebook handy for sure, but don’t try to record every single thing you learn. 

If you’re in the US or would be applying to US vet schools, what I would recommend doing is taking basic notes about when you started and finished shadowing there, a record of how many hours you’ve spent there, and general notes on what you were able to do/see. Such as helping restrain patients, observing dentals and surgeries, staining slides, cleaning kennels, etc. If/when you apply to vet school, the application wants all of these details. I had a heck of a time trying to come up with start/end dates and hours of experiences I had many years prior. Keeping track of your experiences now will make that easier down the line.|I didn’t find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I’m glad I didn’t waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn’t study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they’re used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments. Be aware of which ones are zoonotic or ones important to public health and why. That covers the large bulk of the questions. Then brush up on your antibiotic and common parasite knowledge, a bit of epidemiology concepts/equations, and some basic business concepts, and you’ll be pretty well rounded on the necessary knowledge. I don’t understand why spending a couple hundred hours answering questions has become so many people’s main study method. If it works for you, great.

Consider if your mental and emotional health can cope with clients screaming at you and accusing you of personally murdering their dog because they didn’t bring it in soon enough or because the client can’t pay for care, cope with neglectful owners, cope with euthanizing animals that could otherwise be saved, cope with making a mistake that may cost an animal their life, and overall cope with seeing animals suffer on a daily basis. It can be a very rewarding job, but there are days where it will absolutely beat you to the ground and keep kicking while you’re there. This is why I would strongly advise shadowing before deciding if it’s for you or not. There’s nothing wrong with taking a non-animal job and making animals how you decompress in your free time instead.|I wouldn’t get as hung up on taking notes about what you learn. It will likely be pretty overwhelming in the beginning, and as others have said, you’ll have years to learn that stuff in depth. Simple repeated exposure to terminology and concepts will help them stick better down the road. Have a notebook handy for sure, but don’t try to record every single thing you learn. 

If you’re in the US or would be applying to US vet schools, what I would recommend doing is taking basic notes about when you started and finished shadowing there, a record of how many hours you’ve spent there, and general notes on what you were able to do/see. Such as helping restrain patients, observing dentals and surgeries, staining slides, cleaning kennels, etc. If/when you apply to vet school, the application wants all of these details. I had a heck of a time trying to come up with start/end dates and hours of experiences I had many years prior. Keeping track of your experiences now will make that easier down the line.|I didn’t find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I’m glad I didn’t waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn’t study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they’re used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments. Be aware of which ones are zoonotic or ones important to public health and why. That covers the large bulk of the questions. Then brush up on your antibiotic and common parasite knowledge, a bit of epidemiology concepts/equations, and some basic business concepts, and you’ll be pretty well rounded on the necessary knowledge. I don’t understand why spending a couple hundred hours answering questions has become so many people’s main study method. If it works for you, great. But I found directly studying the diseases to be a much better use of my time.|Apparently some people were getting scores with other people’s names on them.

Hopefully they get it sorted quick and still release them today.|As someone currently in their small animal internal medicine rotation with just 2 other students, trying to keep up with multiple in-depth work ups each day plus rechecks, I’m both appalled and a little jealous that some schools have students sharing cases.|I would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic. You may fall in love and discover your passion, or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job. Working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect, so I would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place. Loving cats is a great start, but that alone isn’t a good reason to work for a vet. Make sure you’re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are. 

If you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it, there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. They are similar but different positions, especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed. Vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more, but also means more schooling and more responsibility/stress. There are legitimate, respected vet tech schools online, but you’ll still need to find a physical clinic to work with and let you learn the physical skills involved in order to complete the program. In general, vet med is a heavily education and science based field, so more education is generally looked upon favorably, so long as it is from reputable sources.

Vet assistant doesn’t require any courses, though online courses exist and may or may not give you a boost at getting a job as an assistant. Many of them are on the job trained, but that’s easier to do if they at least have some background in working with animals. Kennel assistant is similar and also typically on the job trained, however the pay for both of these positions is usually quite low. I would check job listings in your area to see if it’s even financially feasible for you. 

The last bit of advice I have is to also consider finding a non-animal job with a better work-life balance and make volunteering with cats at the humane society or a rescue more of a hobby.

Your external IP is not revealed to any of the users of the network.

I suspect you probably have relatively slow internet bandwidth and the mysterium node was using it all up leaving you with a slow and unreliable connection.

You can fix this by implementing AQM (active queue management) on your router/gateway. There is lots of info about it if you look here [https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/What\_can\_I\_do\_about\_Bufferbloat/](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/What_can_I_do_about_Bufferbloat/) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ydbp1q/how_much_would_i_earn/itzsjrc/ | Are you hosting any other services other than mysterium? Because if you are then that may be how you are being targeted.

Or your ISP has given you a crappy router that does not expect to have so many incoming connections.

My node can have over 600 connections in 24 hours and I think thats only counting the connections which actually transfer data. There are probably 1000s of incoming connections every day.

My node has made 200 myst in 17 days and my connection had been rock solid.

But I run OpenWRT as a router and had FQ\_CoDel which will share my bandwidth across all users and keep my ping low ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ydbp1q/how_much_would_i_earn/iu0es9o/ | Ah I dont use the VPN myself but I know you will be limtied by the connection speed of the node you connect to.

I actually run my router OS as a virtual machine on Proxmox this allows me to send all myst traffic over a VLAN to the myst node running on the same hardware. This way the traffic never makes it onto my LAN.

I suspect your router is supplied by your ISP and as such not the best.

I think mysterium can make me about £70 a month so maybe investing a bit into your network/router could be worth it? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ydbp1q/how_much_would_i_earn/iu0k73h/ | Are you trying to follow this tutorial? https://docs.dappnode.io/get-started/installation/custom-hardware/installation/script/ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y8lzbi/dappnote/itqiefx/ | Yea I don't run a dappnode i just run mysterium on its own but if you have succesfully installed the dappnode then you now need to access it which can be dont via a proxy

However, once your container is installed you will need to navigate to it via a web browser at http://dappnode.local

I think my node should make approx £70 this month and I can get an additional broadband line for approx £40 per month (looking for something with a 50mbps+ upload).

Of course, then you need two routers and multiple myst nodes. But you virtualise all of this gear so not an issue there really.

I would be worried that the MYST price drops and you cant cash out enough to cover the line rental and then you're making a loss until the price comes up again.

I don't route my traffic through the VPN it's just an endpoint for the mysterium network so I can earn some crypto.

I did have to enable IP routing on the host (proxmox) to allow the  myst node to work correctly and have full cone NAT.

&#x200B;

But may I ask why you want to route all your traffic through a VPN? I can understand streaming through it to avoid geo-blocking. But other than that it costs money and complexity to your internet access. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xznret/home_network_vpn_with_spare_pc_as_router_running/irqtj7k/ | I use a service called NextDNS so when a user connects to my exit node their DNS queries are resolved by NextDNS. I then have a separate config for all myst traffic in NextDNS and I filter out the nasty stuff that way.

It's not perfect as they could get around it but it adds a layer of security, also from what I understand the mysterium network already has some filters which restrict what can get onto their network.

I the end I set up the Linux client on an LXC container on proxmox with a VLAN so the traffic is isolated from my network. This proxmox hypervisor also runs my router OpenWRT in a VM so the traffic literally never gets past the fist box in my network.

I did also have to enable ip\_forwarding on proxmox and also a port forward on the router to the myst node.

I have a doctorate degree, whether I can practice medicine is separate from my degree.

Whether I trust someone or they have the legal ability to make medical decisions is a much different conversation than whether the degree they poses makes them a doctor.

PurpleSludgey737,"I'm a PM in the US. We head hunt 3rd and 4th year students who have excellent references from their professors. We then offer a contact to work for us for 5-10 years (depends on your production once employed) in exchange for paying for the 3rd and/or 4th year of school, along with a 10-20k relocation bonus of which students normally put 10-5k towards their school debt. There is a huge need here, and practices are willing to help you if you perform well in school, interview well, and pass the NAVLE. 

Learning the ins and outs of production and evaluating what a potential practice offers in terms of support, education, and estimate padding without financially castrating your client base should be a high priority for all new veterinary students. Also, never accept an offer from a practice that has negative production accrual, or you will fall even deeper into debt and be chained to the practice forever. A standard production percentage for new grads is 21-22%, paid out either monthly or quarterly. Many new grads put this towards their debt their first few years practicing. Make sure your first practice is run appropriately ie- will you receive production for rx's refilled, rx diets sold, etc? The answer should be yes.

OP - corporate practices and private practices have pros and cons;

Corporate Pros - huge capex bucket for repairs and maintenance and the newest technology, great rates with their primary labs that your PM can trickle down to your clients, pet funds for financially constrained pet parents, fully paid travel and sign up for CE events, a huge HR team accessible to all if you feel that something unjust is happening, a large network of hospitals to barrow LVTs or DVM from if you are short staffed, if you're having a bad quarter there is no threat of shutting the practice down because the corporate overlord will pay your bills until you are up on your feet again, etc.

Corporate Cons - red tape that hinders everything from the hiring process to changing your hospital's core values,  a lack of flexibility for DVM PTO usage, highly restrictive staffing ratios, strictly enforced overtime policies for your staff, pay range caps that cannot be challenged, etc. 

Private Pros - Your PM is truly in charge of your hospital from culture to hiring and more, normally having a direct line to the practice owner should serious concerns arise, supreme flexibility when it comes to schedule and PTO, in a good practice the money coming in is then distributed amongst the staff in the form of discretionary bonuses, you have the freedom to more easily terminate abusive clients, and in my experience you tend to have deeper ties to your local community, etc.

Private Cons - The practice normally lives and dies by the availability and patient capacity of the clinic & DVMs, a bad quarter or a DVM retiring will mean layoffs, if the hospital owner or PM are toxic then there is no HR to go to for solutions, 2nd or 3rd generation technology due to having normal opposed to deep pockets, most repairs are a PM or owner trying to fix the broken thing until it is officially ready for the garbage, if you get sued then you do not have the financial backing to fight something in court forever, etc.

And I went to Purdue and didn’t think the experience was as bad as described. It’s absolute dog shit, almost every rotation has a few bad eggs with some have nearly all, but that’s also life a lot of the time. I found it easier to bond with the residents (regardless of age) who would then make the grading a hell of a lot easier. I never got any criticism that wasn’t legit or that I at least could look at and say, “well yeah, I’m still learning”.

I have the same concern in the back of my mind with it, but evidence based medicine is the standard.|Hey, as a more recent grad, I’ll share my experience. We had the same people come to us saying the same things about not making production your first year. 

I worked at a busy (not kinda busy, not very busy, just normal busy) 4 Doctor GP practice and worked about 40hr/wk. Decent split between wellness and sick visits, solid number of surgeries, etc. I didn’t make production my first month due to doing all sorts of admin stuff, occasional shadowing in the first two weeks, etc. I made production every other month from then onward. 

It truly will depend on where you end up working - if you’re in a MCOL city and above, you’ll absolutely make production. I have a few friends from school that did have some negative accrual, but they worked in more LCOL areas (think middle of the country). 

As much as money is important, I wouldn’t stress too much about the production aspect. Ask for 20% because it’s standard and be done with it. Negotiate for the highest salary you can and remember that you’re in charge - there’s a vet shortage that gives you *much* more negotiation power. Being a new grad lowers that obviously. However what you should push for in terms of salary varies widely on where you live. Out of school in a MCOL I got $100,000/yr in salary. 

Also try to get any sign on bonus you can and push for it to be for only ONE year. Definitely not 3.|Spays are the worst surgery no matter how deep into the profession you are. I still very much hate them to this day. You should not feel incompetent. 

We also all make mistakes. Just today I diagnosed atresia ani on the kitten’s SECOND visit to me. I think back about how I should’ve been paying attention to the fact there was no rectum (the patient had a rectovaginal fistula so I initially thought the vagina was the rectum and wasn’t thinking to look at a vagina at all - always do a full PE). It sucks but I learned. 

I struggled hard for the first few months/year(s) in separating my work from my life outside of work. It’s a good idea to set time aside like you’ve said for continued learning outside of the pressure of appointments but also remember you’re more than a veterinarian and *should* be more than a veterinarian. You will grow even faster if you’re mentally well rested. Find ways to disconnect. It won’t always be perfect, I can still have a weekend ruined by overthinking on cases.

But I do agree- the lack of oversight has lead to many abusive programs.

I also have concerns about the numbers of residency programs (in both academia and private practice ) that require extensive non competes or agreements to work for the group for xxxyears. This seems predatory.

- Ask for specifics on what the mentorship structure will look like

Murphalurf,"A thing to keep in mind with the hands off corporations: they're hands off because they don't know and refuse to manage individual practices.  This applies especially to some of these newer groups that started with venture capitalists, most have no experience in vet med.  The corp that I worked for was so hands off that their regional manager wasn't allowed to visit more than once a quarter unless it was a crisis.  What this does is create unfamiliarity to each clinic and wasted time describing needs and wants over and over again.  What they do know is how to buy a clinic, not improve or maintain it beyond basic management or lobby face lifts.

Another thing to keep in mind is a lot of these hands off corporations don't change previous clinic benefits, so the benefits could vary from clinic to clinic.  This is great during the beginning buyout because nothing really changes, but it also eludes any infrastructure to create a plan to improve benefits.  Wild situations of staff getting a 5k a year bonus vs a larger clinic handing out $100, differences in how staff discounts are applied, etc.  

They keep clinics where they were when they bought them out.  Getting improvements in benefits outside of what the Corp allows all clinics is impossible, even when other clinics could have better benefits than the others.  

To be clear, you don't want red tape and micro management in your practice, but at the end of the day the corps will demand the price increases and dictate raise allowances with practices they have no idea who they are.  Clinics that need a lot of help don't get the support they need and you tend to compete for staff with sister clinics in the area.

I've never worked with a bigger Corp like VCA or Banfield, so this could be the same across the board, but keep in mind hands off doesn't mean better in all circumstances.|Olympia veterinarian here, you'll make more than 100k a year no problem.

Also worth noting is that usually in January both of those have a 'sale' so the amount of days you purchase for them extends until after the November/December window, if you're going to dish out the cash then it's better to do that. Zuku (and I think vet prep too) does question-of-the-day emails for free so you can sign up for those but you're only gonna get a hundred or so questions total by the April window. You can also poke around online, some schools have NAVLE-style questions on their websites. 

The biggest benefit of those sites is the ability to get questions with good feedback. So it really is worth buying one. You can gimmick the materials they provide but there's not much to replace the thousands of practice questions they have. 

Also, take ICVA practice tests to know where you stand. There are 3 of them, only one allows you to see which questions you got wrong, and the others just give a score.

A 'vet tech' is a veterinary technician, there are two common types, licensed and unlicensed. Licensed 'vet techs' have gone to a veterinary technician school, have taken an exam, and passed, they are equivalent to being a registered nurse in the vet world. Depending on the state and hospital, unlicensed 'techs' are trained on the job and may have little to no educational training at all, it's just a title to show seniority; some states or practices won't allow someone who has not been licensed to have the 'veterinary technician' title. Unlicensed vet techs are actually vet assistants but that title (in my and most people's opinion) feels too low for all they do; after all, they are not the type of assistant you see on TV who just gets coffee.

In the US, Veterinarians go to Vet school for 4 years only AFTER completing a bachelor's degree for 4 years; I know some countries have 6-year programs you can directly enter after high school (or equivalent). Depending on the country and the type of vet school you go to (6 year vs others) the AVMA may or may not allow you to sit for the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE). This is the big exam that allows you to practice in the US. I know some countries are can take another exam (the Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Equivalence PAVE), complete a clinical year in the US, and then take the NAVLE.

Go online to AVMA's website and I think you should find info relevant to your situation there, or be able to contact someone who knows more! I hope this helps!|Someone already said it, but you have to already have the Doctor degree or equivalent (or about to receive it in the final year as a student) before you can take the NAVLE. You can graduate and have the Doctor title but you can't practice medicine without taking the NAVLE. You could teach, work in research, or similar things without passing the NAVLE but you can't see patients or do medicine without the NAVLE.

The NAVLE is only for Doctors. Licensed Vet techs take a different exam called the VTNE.|Sorry this ended up being very lengthy!

1. while you are in high school do well enough to get accepted into a decent university and have an overall good GPA to help with this. A lot of universities offer different pre-veterinary degrees that you should go for. These (in theory) will make sure you get all of the required classes to apply to vet school. Make sure to take a ton of science classes and make sure to do really really well in them. Take as many credit hours (classes) as you are allowed. Vet schools want to see that you do really good in science, and that you can handle 6/7+ classes a semester, because that is what you will be doing if you get accepted. 
2. We are all burnt out and struggling mentally, but it is otherwise very rewarding. Take an interest in mental health and caring for your own mental well-being, you will have to do that a lot, especially in vet school. it is also worth noting that the vet world seems to be looking up. the older vets are all still depressed and struggling, but the new generation doesn't seem to be as bad (or maybe that is my experience)
3. to put some big scary numbers to it: the AVMA (American veterinary medical association) releases statistics yearly about the state of Vet Med. This year average student debt for vet school alone was $145,000. Starting Salaries were around 115,000/year for new grads. These are very subjective depending on where you go and other things, but these numbers are looking better than they did in the past. Also keep in mind that there is not a ton of upward movement to salaries over time, or there hasn't been in the past. Offset your tuition cost by going to an in-state school (the vet school in the state you live in, or a vet school that contracts with your state to provide in-state tuition to a certain number of students form your school), living modestly and not paying the highest rent around, scholarships, savings, dont take any grad plus loans, etc. 
4. some schools do track for large animal or small animal vets, but the NAVLE (licensing exam) is over everything and majority small animal, so most teach everything and you can go into one vs the other later. Also salaries for large animal vets are much lower than small animal vets.",Vet

Diagnostic radiology has a more broad scope and is needed everywhere. Still requires specializing.

I’ve scrubbed in for so many cat neuters and it’s astonishing that some is going to spend $350 for a cat neuter.|That is 100% correct.

panic_ye_not,"Interesting. I also don't know how I got to this sub, because I'm a dentist lol.


But in dentistry in my area, I think most dentists go by ""Dr. _____"" with their staff and even with other dentists unless they're personally close. Shortly after graduation I even told people they could call me by my first name and they still called me Dr. ______ because the norm is already so established in most offices I've been to.

DrVetDent,"I'm one of those pesky 17yr old Scottish students who got into vet school straight out the gate, graduated at 22, and now in North America prepping for a specialty college board exam 🙋‍♂️ i.e. the root cause of your partners application problems.

Jokes aside, I want to highlight that your partner IS NOT competing with the UK high school students - each university allocates spots to UK and to international applicants (and in Scotland, some spaces for Scottish students, some rest of UK, and then international). This comes down to requirements from the government regarding university funding.

High school education in the UK vs North America is like comparing apples and oranges, unless your high school ran an International Baccalaureate program. We are examined at a level equivalent to year 1-2 of a North American undergrad degree before starting vet school.

Long story short, your partner is competing with fellow North Americans. And she is applying to three of the top 10 vets schools in the world (RVC, Edinburgh, Glasgow), which have ~40 international spots up for grabs/yr.

Best of luck to her, I hope that she is successful soon!|I think you skipped over the part of my reply where I pointed out that she is not competing against UK students. The UK government requires that a certain number of spots are reserved for domestic candidates, while a certain number are open to international/foreign trained students. 

I went to Edinburgh, where ~60% of my year were from the UK or Europe, and the remaining 40% were North American. Unsure of how the allocation of positions has changed since Brexit, but anecdotally I've heard it's more 50:50 Domestic:North American. AVMA-accredited, so it was relatively easy to cross the pond.

vetsquared,"A lot of what clinicians do is generally cultural. So we like to think that science guides everything that we do but that’s just not the case.

We have solid data to show from decades of ovariectomies in Europe yet for some reason that’s not convincing enough for everyone to change their behavior.

To answer your question then…no idea why we cherry pick.  Confirmation bias, fallacious thinking, habit, peer pressure, probably all play a role.|I perform scrotal ablations on almost every older dog neuter to prevent this.  Scrotal hematomas are nasty and are not good for client relationships.

I completed most of my basic pre-reqs (gen chem, orgo, biology) with fairly good grades. I’m planning on completing a post bacc to complete the other science credits I need. I haven’t had a lot of extracurricular vet experience during school —- I attend a pretty intense college and have been managing some mental health struggles. My STEM GPA is 3.1 currently, and my overall GPA is 3.6. I did complete a summer internship at an equine rescue/rehab, and worked for a summer at a vet clinic in high school. I grew up with tons of animals!
Questions:
How do you gain veterinary experience with a non-stem major? Where/when can you start?
What do vet schools think about gap years? (I’m planning to take some time off and do/learn about other things I love — farming, backpacking, travel — before vet school.)
What can you do as a vet beyond small animal or equine? Are there positions that allow you to travel and/or help places without many vets, kind of like Doctors Without Borders? 
Is work/life balance pretty impossible? :/
