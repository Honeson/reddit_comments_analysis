It’s never too late to consider vet med as a career and undergrad is a great opportunity to push yourself and make yourself competitive.\\n\\nI will play devils advocate though. I am a second year resident and I’m burnt out already. Undergrad is 4 years, vet school is another 4, and residency is 3. If you want to do aquatic medicine then it will likely be another 2 years of rotating and specialty internships before residency. That’s upwards of 13 years of training ahead of you. Vet Med can be rewarding, but it is hard and long to get to the end of your training. I’m not saying this to discourage you, but simply to make sure you know what you would be commuting to. You have to be driven and always keep your eye on the prize. Be prepared for long nights, long weeks, and long years.|As someone who knows people looking for path jobs in diagnostics/industry, this information is not current. Most diagnostic centers have placed a hold on hiring and industry has definitely slowed down. Also, pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD.|Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med. For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then it’s not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because that’s how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer. \\n\\nFor those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us). Did they know everything coming out? No. None of us do. Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice (which I think it’s clear that OP is). What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice. If you are a technician OR a doctor, this is a useful skill to learn. Technicians know things doctors don’t know and doctors don’t know things technicians know. Instead of belittling each other, they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice.|I think a lot of other people made some good points so I’m not going to repeat a lot of it.
